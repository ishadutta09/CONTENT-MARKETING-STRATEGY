As part of my final internship completion project, I was assigned to develop a comprehensive content marketing strategy for a beauty and skincare brand. The goal was to create a real-world, actionable plan that outlines content creation, distribution, audience engagement, performance tracking, and promotion tactics.

This task involved identifying the target market, creating an editorial calendar, generating blog topic ideas, selecting content formats, and suggesting both organic and paid marketing approaches. The strategy needed to be visually engaging, insightful, and practical for implementation by a real brandâ€”GlowAura Skincare.
